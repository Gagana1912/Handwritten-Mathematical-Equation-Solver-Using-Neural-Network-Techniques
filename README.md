# Handwritten-Mathematical-Equation-Solver-Using-Neural-Network-Techniques
Using Convolutional Neural Network to create a robust handwritten equation solver in image processing. The aim is to develop a system that recognizes and solves handwritten mathematical equations. The
system must be able to find solutions for normal equations, linear system equations, quadratic equations, cubic equations, and differential equations. The system returns the roots as the results of
 the equation.
